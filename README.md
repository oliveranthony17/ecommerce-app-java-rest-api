This is the backend for my e-commerce app. I created the app using __Spring Boot__ and connected this to a local database which was created using __MySQLWorkbench__. 

Below are some screenshots of the __Intellij IDE__ and also the REST API generated by the app. This API is called through a service on the __Angular__ frontend app. You can find the code for the frontend __[here](https://github.com/oliveranthony17/ecommerce-app-angular-frontend)__.
